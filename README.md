# marcus-s' MIDI Controller repo

In this repo I keep some small code I basically wrote for myself to be able to use MIDI controllers in Linux DAWs which are otherwise not usable.

The code is mostly rudimentary and, in many cases, can be optimized.

Controllers:
- AKAI Midi Mix

Requirements:
- sendosc tool compiled and installed to /usr/bin - https://github.com/yoggy/sendosc
- liboscpack-dev and liboscpack1 to compile sendosc


## Akai MIDI Mix

The midimix.cpp file will generate a tool which will read a file in /tmp, generated by the AkaiMidiMix.sh script, which is also in this repo. The script needs to run in the background as well, so that the program can read from the tmp-file. The midimix.cpp is currently statically set to port 9000 - but this can easily be adapted in the code prior to compiling.

Bank shifting is also intercepted and allows you to infinitely shift banks right or left, each step shifts up or down by eight respectively.

The master slider is also intercepted and sent on a separate OSC path.

Compile the tool with g++ midimix.cpp -w -O2 -o ./midimix

Run the script first, and then the resulting midimix program. Open your DAW of choice and add a OSC-based MIDI controller to the configuration, which listens to port 9000.
